\begin{abstract}
Housing re-investments are rising, but we know little about real cost of DAs. Using a final (unbalanced panel) sample exceeding 58,000 of repeat sales with a high likelihood of DA construction from 2000 to 2016, we provide evidence that the the home buyers carrying out developments get back less for a dollar invested. Critically, we confirm the negative relationship of returns to DA investments in a repeat sales experiment design with a difference-in-difference approach including control for the age of the development and construction type. The finding of a negative relationship is generally consistent/inconsistent with similar studies in the US. We argue that such changes have fundamentally impacted the underlying process responsible for the previously observed relationship. In addition, some recent studies, the inconsistency is also partly explained by a failure to fully account for unobserved, time-invariant, firm-level heterogeneity which we show of critical importance.\\

\maketitle American Economics Journal Pointers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Do not use an "Introduction" heading. Begin your $$(x+1)$$ and $$(x+5)$$ introductory material before the first section heading.

\item Avoid style markup (except sparingly for emphasis).
\item Avoid using explicit vertical or horizontal space.
\item Captions are short and go below figures but above tables.
\item The tablenotes or figurenotes environments may be used below tables
or figures, respectively, as demonstrated below.
\item If you have difficulties with the mathtime package, adjust the package
options appropriately for your platform. If you can't get it to work, just
remove the package or see our technical support document online (please
refer to the author instructions).
\item If you are using an appendix, it goes last, after the bibliography.
Use regular section headings to make the appendix headings.
\item If you are not using an appendix, you may delete the appendix command
and sample appendix section heading.
\item Either the natbib package or the harvard package may be used with bibtex.
To include one of these packages, uncomment the appropriate usepackage command
above. Note: you can't use both packages at once or compile-time errors will result.

\end{itemize}

Our paper makes an important contribution to the study of moving bodies, first introduced by Einstein in 1905 \cite{Einstein05}



\section{Differences-in-differences method}
We study the effect of a developments on house prices. So we have control group of properties and the treatment group where the house have carried out developments. 


This method classifies properties as either "treatment" or "control" properties. The latter are the properties that do not experience any development activity over the 1991-2016  period. 


our next tasks are to check the robustnes of these findings to a number of other specifications and to expand the set of registered manufacturing performance measures beyond just output.




The house levels are different ex-ante. so a reasonable assumption would be that the log of the house prices evolve in the same way absent house development. Therefore we have $$ log(y_i) = \gamma_s + \lambda_t +\beta D_{ts} + \epsilon_i$$




\section{lines}
we would expect firms in the registered sector to substitute away from the labor. 

The key affect piece of central legislation is the industrial disputes ... which set out the .....

column (1) replicates the basic result from table 3. ...... In column .. we add a number of controls

In column .. we add ssd specific time trends. In this case, the identification of the effects of developments come from whthere such developments lead to deviations from the preexisting ssd specific trends.
